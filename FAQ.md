# Frequently Asked Questions
» Scenario: *I completed a quest, whose reward is needed in another quest. I have searched my bank and other classes, and this item is not to be found. What do I do?*
- First, try `/fixquests`. 
- Your only remaining option is to complete that quest on another class, and transfer it to your main class via your bank. 

» Scenario: *I stupidly dropped my item in a hopper or on the ground, and now it's gone! Can I have a refund?*
<br/> » Scenario: *I died and dropped all of my items. I returned to where I dropped them, and they're gone! Can an admin give me my items back?*
<br/> » Scenario: *I logged out and logged back in to find that some of my items disappeared from my inventory. Can I get my items back?*
- Wynncraft enforces a strict no refund policy, a policy which applies to all players, including staff and content team members. Although this seems unfair, it's actually our method of maintaining fairness among our playerbase. 
– Even if you are being honest, the no refund policy still stands. 

» Scenario: *I'm stuck in a hole or box and can't get out. Can an admin teleport me out? Thx. IGN: wynner123*
- Please do `/kill` with 5 or more soul points.

» Scenario: *I glitched out of the map and into a flat world. I see a lot of structures. What should I do?*
- In order to not get banned, please do `/kill` immediately with 5 or more soul points. 

» Scenario: *I'm **not** in the boss room of a dungeon and something has broken. Can someone help me?*
- Switching servers while not in the boss room of a dungeon is safe. Try to find a recently restarted server and proceed as normal. If you still are having an issue, please report it [here](https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/).

» Scenario: *Some form of the Guild system is broken. HELP ME PLEASE*
